    This is a custom gunicorn worker class, based on the standard gevent worker
    but with some extra operational- and debugging-related features:

        * a background thread that monitors execution by checking for:

            * blocking of the gevent event-loop, with tracebacks
              logged if blocking code is found.

            * overall memory usage, with forced-gc and graceful shutdown
              if memory usage goes beyond a defined limit.

        * a timeout enforced on each individual request, rather than on
          inactivity of the worker as a whole.

        * a signal handler to dump memory usage data on SIGUSR2.

    To detect eventloop blocking, the worker installs a greenlet trace
    function that increments a counter on each context switch.  A background
    (os-level) thread monitors this counter and prints a traceback if it has
    not changed within a configurable number of seconds.
