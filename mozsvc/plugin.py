"""
Plugin loading system using zope.interface and the pyramid registry.

This module provides a simple plugin-loading system on top of pyramid's
internal component registry.  Suppose you have a plugin interface declared
like so::

    from zope.interface import Interface

    class IMyPlugin(Interface):
        pass

And a concrete implementation of it in "mymodule.MyPluginImpl"::

    from zope.interface import implements

    class MyPluginImpl(object):
        implements(IMyPlugin)
        def __init__(self, foo, bar):
            pass

You can specify a section in your config file like this::

    [plugin1]
    backend = mymodule.MyPluginImpl
    foo = frob
    bar = baz

Then when you come to initialize your Pyramid app configuration, you
just ask it to load and register your plugin like so::

    from mozsvc.plugin import load_and_register

    config = Configurator(...etc...)
    plugin = load_and_register("plugin1", config)

This will read the configuration to find the "backend" declaration and resolve
it to a class, parse each of the other configuration options to use as keyword
arguments, and create an instance of the class for you.

The load_and_register function also registers the loaded plugin with pyramid's
component registry.  This means you can look it up in any other part of your
code by doing the following:

    plugin = request.registry.queryUtility(IMyPlugin)

If you're not interested in this and want to skip all the zope interface
palaver, you can also use *just* the plugin loading functionality by using::

    plugin = load_from_config(section_name, config_obj)

or::

    plugin = load_from_settings(section_name, settings_dict)
